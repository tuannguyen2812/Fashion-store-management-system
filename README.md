<h3 align="left">I. Introduction</h3>
  The goal of this store management system is to assist retailers in keeping track of their inventory. The system's basic features, such as adding, editing, removing, and finding, would help you carry out straightforward tasks. Users can quickly and easily become familiar with the application because of its user-friendly interface. 
  The project's primary audience is retail establishments, including clothing boutiques, computer shops, bookshops, and pharmacies. As a result, this project will be an efficient and helpful tool for all types of stores, enabling them to manage their inventory in the best possible way.

<h3 align="left">IV. Discussion</h3>
The limitations of our program are that only basic operations like adding, removing, updating, displaying, and showing products sorted by price are currently available through
the software. However, we have allowed users to return to the main menu, end the program, or repeat the function as needed. We will try our best to make the program adaptable and offer additional conveniences to the shop management system for future work so that more people may interact with our program.

<h3 align="left">V. Conclusion</h3>
The store management system program has been successfully developed using the programming language C. This application has scenarios and features that make it simple to add, search, remove, modify, and display items. From this project, we learned how to build an application and create simple functions using C programming language. Additionally, we
also have an opportunity to develop our cooperation skills and the relationships between members.
